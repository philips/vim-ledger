This is the ledger filetype for vim.
Copy each file to the corresponding directory in your ~/.vim directory.
Then include the following line in your .vimrc  or in ~/.vim/filetype.vim
  au BufNewFile,BufRead *.ldg,*.ledger setf ledger
You can also use a modeline like this in every ledger file
  vim:filetype=ledger

Configuration
======================================================================
Include the following let-statements somewhere in your .vimrc
to modify the behaviour of the ledger filetype.

Number of colums that will be used to display the foldtext.
Set this when you think that the amount is too far off to the right.
let g:ledger_maxwidth = 80

String that will be used to fill the space between account name
and amount in the foldtext. Set this to get some kind of lines
or visual aid.
let g:ledger_fillstring = '    -'
